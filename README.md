# Urban Asset Library

Welcome to the Open-Source Urban Asset Library! To imagine future urban environments, we have to first understand current urban environments, which means understanding what is in current envoronments. This repository is intended to be a comprehensive collection of urban assets designed for creating urban digital twins for simulation research. This asset library will also be mirrored on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/@HenryLevesque/collections/1560825). These models can be 3D printed at 1:48 scale (or scaled up or down to fit your use case) to help visualize and provide examples of urban environments.

## Overview

The Urban Asset Library provides a variety of assets that can be used to build detailed and accurate digital representations of urban environments. These assets are essential for researchers and developers working on urban simulations, smart city projects, and other related fields.
